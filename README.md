### Here is how I calculated the predicted weights using the formula CriticalThink gave me (based on the WGS84 model)

```python wgs84.py```

### Here is how you can calculate the gravity at the pole summing disks for any spheroid given earth's mass and volume (no centrifugal effect):

```python calc-oblate-polar-gravity.py```

### Here is the same code in javascript that is used for my online calculator
